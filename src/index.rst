Welcome to the Annotation of the Transcriptional Cancer Atlas!
==============================================================

Version: |version|
|br| 
Last change: |today|

This website contains a detailed description of the classes available in the transcriptional cancer atlas, a curated resource of 
gene expression data clustering from the Hospital for Sick Children. The atlas was produced with `RACCOON <https://github.com/fcomitani/raccoon>`_, 
a scale-adaptive clustering algorithm, and serves as a target to the `OTTER <insert link to OTTER web page here when available>`_ classifier. 

The data was gathered from different sources, including the `TreeHouse Childhood Cancer Initiative <https://treehousegenomics.ucsc.edu/>`_, 
`TCGA <https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga>`_,
`TARGET <https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target>`_ ,
`GTEx <https://gtexportal.org/home/>`_, and
`St. Jude Children's Research Hospital <https://pecan.stjude.cloud/>`_.

The classes have been manually annotated. Each one has been characterized based on its most relevant transcriptional properties and,
where available, clinical and genomics information. 

This website is still a work in progress. We are striving to cover all subtypes currently available in the atlas, please check back in the future
if what you are looking for is still not available.
For questions, comments or suggestions, please :ref:`contacts`. See also our :ref:`faq` section.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The annotation is updated periodically, make sure you are looking at a version
that is matching the classifier used in your project.

   Possibly add maybe the version should be published too with Zenodo.
